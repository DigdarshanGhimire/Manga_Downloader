# Manga_Downloader

This program is  on the initial phase of development.

But let me give a brief overview of how this is gonna work

  1. The main file will actually be the main.py file where all the downloading stuff takes place
  2. The gui.py will provide a user interface to interact with main.py file
  3. Three directories will be created. i.e. ('manga_pages','manga_chapters_pdf','onedownloads')
  4. manga_pages directory will hold all pages of a chapter which will be downloaded from manga4life.com
  5. When all the pages are downloaded, they will be converted into a single pdf and saved in manga_chapters_pdf
  6. onedownloads will store a page of a chapter
